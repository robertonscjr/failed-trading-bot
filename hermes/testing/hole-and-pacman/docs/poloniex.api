Push API
The best way to get public data updates on markets is via the push API, which pushes live ticker, order book, trade, and Trollbox updates over WebSockets using the WAMP protocol. In order to use the push API, connect to wss://api.poloniex.com and subscribe to the desired feed.

Ticker
In order to receive ticker updates, subscribe to "ticker". Updates will be in the following format:

['BTC_BBR','0.00069501','0.00074346','0.00069501','-0.00742634','8.63286802','11983.47150109',0,'0.00107920','0.00045422']

Appropriate labels for these data are, in order: currencyPair, last, lowestAsk, highestBid, percentChange, baseVolume, quoteVolume, isFrozen, 24hrHigh, 24hrLow

Order Book and Trades
To receive order book and trade updates, subscribe to the desired currencyPair, e.g. "BTC_XMR". There are two types of order book updates:

[{data: {rate: '0.00300888', type: 'bid', amount: '3.32349029'},type: 'orderBookModify'}]

[{data: {rate: '0.00311164', type: 'ask' },type: 'orderBookRemove'}]

Updates of type orderBookModify can be either additions to the order book or changes to existing entries. The value of 'amount' indicates the new total amount on the books at the given rate â€” in other words, it replaces any previous value, rather than indicates an adjustment to a previous value.

Trade history updates are provided in the following format:

[{data: {tradeID: '364476',rate: '0.00300888',amount: '0.03580906',date: '2014-10-07 21:51:20',total: '0.00010775',type: 'sell'},type: 'newTrade'}]

The dictionary portion of each market message ("kwargs" in the Node.js example) will contain a sequence number with the key "seq". In order to keep your order book consistent, you will need to ensure that messages are applied in the order of their sequence numbers, even if they arrive out of order. In some markets, if there is no update for more than 1 second, a heartbeat message consisting of an empty argument list and the latest sequence number will be sent. These will go out once per second, but if there is no update for more than 60 seconds, the heartbeat interval will be reduced to 8 seconds until the next update.

Several order book and trade history updates will often arrive in a single message. Be sure to loop through the entire array, otherwise you will miss some updates.

Trollbox Messages
In order to receive new Trollbox messages, subscribe to "trollbox". Messages will be given in the following format:

['trollboxMessage',2094211,'boxOfTroll','Trololol',4]

Appropriate labels for these data are, in order: type, messageNumber, username, message, reputation

Public API Methods
Please note that making more than 6 calls per second to the public API, or repeatedly and needlessly fetching excessive amounts of data, can result in your IP being banned.

There are six public methods, all of which take HTTP GET requests and return output in JSON format:

Trading API Methods
To use the trading API, you will need to create an API key.

Please note that there is a default limit of 6 calls per second. If you require more than this, please consider optimizing your application using the push API, the "moveOrder" command, or the "all" parameter where appropriate. If this is still insufficient, please contact support to discuss a limit raise.

All calls to the trading API are sent via HTTP POST to https://poloniex.com/tradingApi and must contain the following headers:

Key - Your API key.
Sign - The query's POST data signed by your key's "secret" according to the HMAC-SHA512 method.
Additionally, all queries must include a "nonce" POST parameter. The nonce parameter is an integer which must always be greater than the previous nonce used.

All responses from the trading API are in JSON format. In the event of an error, the response will always be of the following format:

{"error":"<error message>"}

There are several methods accepted by the trading API, each of which is specified by the "command" POST parameter:

returnBalances
Returns all of your available balances. Sample output:

{"BTC":"0.59098578","LTC":"3.31117268", ... }

returnCompleteBalances
Returns all of your balances, including available balance, balance on orders, and the estimated BTC value of your balance. By default, this call is limited to your exchange account; set the "account" POST parameter to "all" to include your margin and lending accounts. Sample output:

{"LTC":{"available":"5.015","onOrders":"1.0025","btcValue":"0.078"},"NXT:{...} ... }

returnDepositAddresses
Returns all of your deposit addresses. Sample output:

{"BTC":"19YqztHmspv2egyD6jQM3yn81x5t5krVdJ","LTC":"LPgf9kjv9H1Vuh4XSaKhzBe8JHdou1WgUB", ... "ITC":"Press Generate.." ... }

generateNewAddress
Generates a new deposit address for the currency specified by the "currency" POST parameter. Sample output:

{"success":1,"response":"CKXbbs8FAVbtEa397gJHSutmrdrBrhUMxe"}

Only one address per currency per day may be generated, and a new address may not be generated before the previously-generated one has been used.

returnDepositsWithdrawals
Returns your deposit and withdrawal history within a range, specified by the "start" and "end" POST parameters, both of which should be given as UNIX timestamps. Sample output:

{"deposits":
[{"currency":"BTC","address":"...","amount":"0.01006132","confirmations":10,

Or, for all markets:

{"BTC_MAID": [ { "globalTradeID": 29251512, "tradeID": "1385888", "date": "2016-05-03 01:29:55", "rate": "0.00014243", "amount": "353.74692925", "total": "0.05038417", "fee": "0.00200000", "orderNumber": "12603322113", "type": "buy", "category": "settlement" }, { "globalTradeID": 29251511, "tradeID": "1385887", "date": "2016-05-03 01:29:55", "rate": "0.00014111", "amount": "311.24262497", "total": "0.04391944", "fee": "0.00200000", "orderNumber": "12603319116", "type": "sell", "category": "marginTrade" }, ... ],"BTC_LTC":[ ... ] ... }

returnOrderTrades
Returns all trades involving a given order, specified by the "orderNumber" POST parameter. If no trades for the order have occurred or you specify an order that does not belong to you, you will receive an error. Sample output:

[{"globalTradeID": 20825863, "tradeID": 147142, "currencyPair": "BTC_XVC", "type": "buy", "rate": "0.00018500", "amount": "455.34206390", "total": "0.08423828", "fee": "0.00200000", "date": "2016-03-14 01:04:36"}, ...]

buy
Places a limit buy order in a given market. Required POST parameters are "currencyPair", "rate", and "amount". If successful, the method will return the order number. Sample output:

{"orderNumber":31226040,"resultingTrades":[{"amount":"338.8732","date":"2014-10-18 23:03:21","rate":"0.00000173","total":"0.00058625","tradeID":"16164","type":"buy"}]}

You may optionally set "fillOrKill", "immediateOrCancel", "postOnly" to 1. A fill-or-kill order will either fill in its entirety or be completely aborted. An immediate-or-cancel order can be partially or completely filled, but any portion of the order that cannot be filled immediately will be canceled rather than left on the order book. A post-only order will only be placed if no portion of it fills immediately; this guarantees you will never pay the taker fee on any part of the order that fills.

sell
Places a sell order in a given market. Parameters and output are the same as for the buy method.

cancelOrder
Cancels an order you have placed in a given market. Required POST parameter is "orderNumber". If successful, the method will return:

{"success":1}

moveOrder
Cancels an order and places a new one of the same type in a single atomic transaction, meaning either both operations will succeed or both will fail. Required POST parameters are "orderNumber" and "rate"; you may optionally specify "amount" if you wish to change the amount of the new order. "postOnly" or "immediateOrCancel" may be specified for exchange orders, but will have no effect on margin orders. Sample output:

{"success":1,"orderNumber":"239574176","resultingTrades":{"BTC_BTS":[]}}

withdraw
Immediately places a withdrawal for a given currency, with no email confirmation. In order to use this method, the withdrawal privilege must be enabled for your API key. Required POST parameters are "currency", "amount", and "address". For XMR withdrawals, you may optionally specify "paymentId". Sample output:

{"response":"Withdrew 2398 NXT."}

returnFeeInfo
If you are enrolled in the maker-taker fee schedule, returns your current trading fees and trailing 30-day volume in BTC. This information is updated once every 24 hours.

{"makerFee": "0.00140000", "takerFee": "0.00240000", "thirtyDayVolume": "612.00248891", "nextTier": "1200.00000000"}

returnAvailableAccountBalances

{"success":1,"message":"Transferred 2 BTC from exchange to margin account."}

returnMarginAccountSummary
Returns a summary of your entire margin account. This is the same information you will find in the Margin Account section of the Margin Trading page, under the Markets list. Sample output:

{"totalValue": "0.00346561","pl": "-0.00001220","lendingFees": "0.00000000","netValue": "0.00345341","totalBorrowedValue": "0.00123220","currentMargin": "2.80263755"}

marginBuy
Places a margin buy order in a given market. Required POST parameters are "currencyPair", "rate", and "amount". You may optionally specify a maximum lending rate using the "lendingRate" parameter. If successful, the method will return the order number and any trades immediately resulting from your order. Sample output:

You may set "currencyPair" to "all" if you wish to fetch all of your margin positions at once. If you have no margin position in the specified market, "type" will be set to "none". "liquidationPrice" is an estimate, and does not necessarily represent the price at which an actual forced liquidation will occur. If you have no liquidation price, the value will be -1. Sample output:

{"amount":"40.94717831","total":"-0.09671314",""basePrice":"0.00236190","liquidationPrice":-1,"pl":"-0.00058655", "lendingFees":"-0.00000038","type":"long"}
